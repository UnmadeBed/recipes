		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			One of the most loved foods in the world! This is a lasagna made the
			traditional Italian way, with a slow cooked ragu and a béchamel sauce
			("Besciamella"). No ricotta - that's the American-Italian version. Though
			it requires patience to make, it is worth every minute. The ragu bolognese
			is melt-in-you-mouth tender and the sauce is rich and thick. Makes 8 giant
			or 10 normal servings
		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
			<li>1 onion</li>
			<li>1 medium carrot</li>
			<li>1 rib / stick of celery</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				RAGU: Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic,
				onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet
				- they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down). Add beef, turn
				heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go. Once the beef has
				all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.
				Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid
				on and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove
				the lid and simmer for 30 minutes. The ragu is ready when the meat is
				really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich - see video for
				consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if
				required (Note 3)
			</li>
			<li>
				CHEESE SAUCE: Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional - just makes sauce
				thicken faster). In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat.
				Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute. Pour about 1 cup of the milk
				in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly
				lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump
				free. Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then
				regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens - about 5 - 8
				minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon. Remove from heat,
				add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The
				Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable - the consistency of
				heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when
				layering - see video). If it's too thick, add a splash of water or milk.
			</li>
			<li>
				ASSEMBLE: Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x
				2.5" baking dish. Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with
				lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit. Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu
				(enough to cover sheets), then drizzle over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top
				with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu,
				then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more
				time. Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the
				remaining Cheese Sauce. Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25
				minutes or until golden and bubbling. Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before
				cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.
