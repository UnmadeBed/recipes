		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Aussies love a good meat pie. We love the hand-held ones because we get
			the whole thing to ourselves. But when youâ€™ve got sharing vibes, this
			Family-size Meat Pie is the one you pull out. With a shortcrust base,
			slow-cooked fall-apart chunks of beef are smothered in a rich gravy,
			topped off with a golden puff pastry lid.
		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>800g/ 1.6lb chuck beef</li>
			<li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
			<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Brown beef: Sprinkle beef with 3/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Heat oil
				in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Brown beef aggressively in 2
				to 3 batches (do not crowd pot, else it gets watery instead of
				browning). Then remove beef into a big bowl.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cook bacon: Cool pot, add bacon. Place pot back onto medium heat. When
				you see some fat starting to melt, turn heat up to medium high and cook
				bacon until golden. Then remove into bowl with beef.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cook mushrooms: Melt 30g/ 2tbsp butter in the pot. Cook mushrooms until
				golden with a pinch of salt and pepper. Remove into separate bowl with
				slotted spoon.
			</li>
		</ol>
